# Spotifio (fresh - UI)

Web app for tracking your spotify playlists

## UI
The app is split into the frontend and backend because of the way fresh renders routes and all I think it's easier to use fresh for UI/UX and just request all the data needed from the server running plain deno so there's more obvious line between what's animating, etc.. frontend stuff and what's only for the server. 

## Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
